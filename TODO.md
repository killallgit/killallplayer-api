- make sure waveform GET sends response of "queued" or others for the client
- We're logging failure over and over after we've finished the jobs. We need to completely remove / cleanup the queue and maybe disable the logs that it's checking because it's noisy
- Test fixtures

## PHASE 4: Testing Implementation (ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS)

## Dependencies to Install
```bash
# Server
go get github.com/gorilla/websocket

# System (macOS)
brew install ffmpeg

# System (Linux)
apt-get install ffmpeg

# Testing tools
npm install -g wscat  # WebSocket testing
```

## Configuration Needed
```yaml
# config.yaml
waveform:
  cache_ttl: 86400  # 24 hours
  max_file_size: 500000000  # 500MB
  default_resolution: 1000  # peaks per waveform
  worker_pool_size: 3
  
websocket:
  max_connections_per_ip: 10
  ping_interval: 30s
  write_timeout: 10s
```

## Technical Notes

### Waveform Generation Approaches
1. **FFmpeg audiowaveform filter**: Most accurate, handles all formats
2. **Raw PCM analysis**: Faster but requires decoding first
3. **Pre-generated thumbnails**: Best for static content

### WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **WebSocket**: Bidirectional, more complex, better for interactive features
- **SSE**: Unidirectional (serverâ†’client), simpler, good enough for progress updates
- **Decision**: WebSocket for future extensibility (playback sync, live transcription)

### Caching Strategy
1. **Database**: Persistent, survives restarts
2. **Redis**: Faster access, optional enhancement
3. **CDN**: For popular episodes, future optimization

### Error Recovery
1. **WebSocket disconnection**: Automatic reconnect with exponential backoff
2. **Processing failure**: Retry up to 3 times with increasing delays
3. **Timeout**: Cancel processing after 5 minutes for any single file

## Progress Tracking

### Current Phase: 4 (Testing Implementation - IN PROGRESS)
### Current Step: 4.2 (Next: Basic FFmpeg unit tests with real audio)

## ðŸ§ª PHASE 4: Testing in Progress
**Testing the complete waveform generation system!**

With Phases 1-3 complete, we have:
- âœ… **Complete waveform generation pipeline** (FFmpeg + Database + Job Queue)  
- âœ… **Background processing** (Worker pool + Progress tracking)
- âœ… **Smart API endpoints** (Automatic job creation + Status reporting)
- âœ… **Test audio clips** extracted and ready for comprehensive testing

**Current focus**: Build comprehensive test suite to validate the complete system before moving to WebSocket implementation.

### Test Files Available:
- `./data/tests/clips/test-5s.mp3` (10KB, 5 seconds) - Quick unit tests
- `./data/tests/clips/test-30s.mp3` (60KB, 30 seconds) - Standard tests

**Next step**: Create FFmpeg unit tests with real audio files to validate the complete pipeline.


- Match the Podcast index endpoints! there's something off about trending and i think maybe we've got wrong shared types
- unified responses. there should be a podcast object, an episode object, a waveform object. every endpoint needs to make sure to return its proper type
