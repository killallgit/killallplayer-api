## Recent Implementation (September 2025)

### ✅ Streaming Endpoint Implementation
**Status**: Complete | **Files**: `api/stream/handler.go`, `api/stream/routes.go`

- Implemented full audio streaming proxy at `/api/v1/stream/:id`
- Added HTTP 206 Partial Content support for seeking
- Transparent redirect handling for audio URLs
- CORS headers for web client compatibility
- HEAD request support for metadata retrieval
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Technical Details**:
- Fetches episode from database by ID
- Proxies audio from `enclosureUrl` field
- Handles redirects (op3.dev → podtrac → transistor.fm)
- Passes through range headers for seeking
- Returns appropriate status codes (200, 206, 404, 502)

### ✅ Viper Configuration Refactoring
**Status**: Complete | **Files**: `pkg/config/config.go`

- Simplified from complex factory pattern to standard Viper usage
- Removed unnecessary service-specific instances
- Fixed environment variable loading issues
- Updated tests to match new configuration pattern

**Lessons Learned**:
- Don't overcomplicate configuration management
- Viper's standard pattern is sufficient for most use cases
- Environment variable prefix and automatic loading work well

### ✅ Database Integration Fixes
**Status**: Complete | **Files**: `internal/database/database.go`, episode repositories

- Fixed episode retrieval with proper GORM queries
- Added verbose SQL logging for debugging
- Resolved "record not found" errors
- Improved error handling and logging

## Known Issues and TODOs

### High Priority
- [ ] Add integration tests for streaming endpoint
- [ ] Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
- [ ] Add authentication system

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement audio processing (waveform generation)
- [ ] Add transcription support
- [ ] Implement caching layer for audio proxying

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add metrics and monitoring
- [ ] Implement user preferences
- [ ] Add playlist functionality

## Development Best Practices Discovered

1. **Configuration Management**
   - Use standard Viper patterns, don't overcomplicate
   - Task runner (Task) with dotenv support is superior to manual env loading
   - Keep configuration structure flat when possible

2. **Database Operations**
   - Enable verbose logging during development
   - Use proper GORM error checking (errors.Is)
   - Always check for record existence before operations

3. **HTTP Streaming**
   - Always handle range requests for audio
   - Pass through important headers (ETag, Last-Modified)
   - Handle redirects transparently in proxy endpoints

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit test configuration and business logic
   - Manual testing for streaming endpoints is acceptable
   - Use curl for API endpoint verification

- **Range Request**: < 300ms for seek operations
- **Database Queries**: < 5ms for episode retrieval
- **API Search**: < 1s for Podcast Index queries

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1** (Complete): Core API and streaming
2. **Phase 2** (Next): WebSocket implementation for real-time updates
3. **Phase 3**: Audio processing pipeline (waveform, chapters)
4. **Phase 4**: Authentication and user management
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced features (playlists, recommendations)
